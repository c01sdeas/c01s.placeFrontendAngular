                        <h4>5. Data Security</h4>
                        <p>We take the security of your data very seriously. We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. These measures include, but are not limited to, data encryption, access controls, and secure server infrastructure.</p>
                        <p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
                        <p>Access to the detailed internal log files (GET, POST, DELETE, UPDATE operations, data payloads, login/logout activity) is strictly limited to authorized members of the c01s.place development team who require access for the purposes outlined in this policy (debugging, security, improvement).</p>

                        <h4>6. Data Retention</h4>
                        <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
                        <p>Internal log data used for development and debugging is periodically reviewed and may be archived or deleted as it is no longer needed for active development or security analysis, in accordance with our internal data management policies.</p>

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under this age. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
